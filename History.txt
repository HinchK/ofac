== 3.0.0 2014-07-17

*  Complete overhaul:
   Converted to a rails engine.
   Since this gem only deals with sdn type of individuals, I optimized the db calls to individuals only.
     Now using a new table ofac_sdn_individuals which replaces ofac_sdn.
     Copy new migrations into your app with bin/rake ofac_engine:install:migrations
     Only loading the individual records into this table
     Using the new table structure to eliminate the like predicate in the SQL.
     Changed class names as appropriate.
       Ofac.new still works, but proper use is now OfacIndividual.new
   The scoring algorithm is unchanged.

== 1.1.12 2010-09-03

* 1 minor enhancement:
  * Changed the method to load the rake tasks from import to load to be jruby friendly.

== 1.1.11 2009-07-29

* 1 minor enhancement:
  * Removed the changes from 1.1.10.  1.1.10 produced a score of 0 when a higher score was more accurate.
    Changed the scoring algorithm to not include partial matches on sounds like.  This code has little impact on score, and
    has a very high overhead on performance.

== 1.1.10 2009-07-28

* 1 minor enhancement:
  * Modified the select in OfacSdn to use the city to pull records from the database.  This is another compromise to improve performance,
    but still get a score.  The db_hit? method is still faster, but this will still calculate a score for accuracy.

== 1.1.9 2009-07-24

* 1 minor enhancement:
  * Added a method, db_hit? for when your more concerned with speed than accuracy.  db_hit? will retun true if there is an exact name match
    in the ofac_sdn database.  This method ignores address and city and does not produce a score.
    Usage: Ofac.new({:name => 'Oscar Hernandez', :city => 'Clearwater', :address => '123 somewhere ln'}).db_hit?


== 1.1.8 2009-06-30

* 1 bug fix:
  * Refactored the select on OfacSdn to use the AR connection instead of building sql and using the raw connection.  Fixes a bug
    introducted in 1.1.6 where quotes in the name raised an error.


== 1.1.7 2009-06-30

* 1 bug fix:
  * fixed error when passing a nil value into the new :first_name or :last_name hash values when initializing the Ofac object.

== 1.1.6 2009-06-29

* 1 minor enhancement:
  * Allow passing of first and last name seperately...to improve performance.


== 1.1.5 2009-06-03

* 1 bug fix:
  * fixed a bug that threw an error if only single character initials are passed in for the name.

== 1.1.4 2009-06-02

* 1 minor enhancement:
  * Improved performance by ignoring initial in names when searching the database for possible hits.

== 1.1.3 2009-05-15

* 1 bug fix:
  * fixed a bug that threw an error if a space was passed in for the name.

== 1.1.2 2009-05-13

* 2 minor changes:
  * Changed the sql in the initial search to do a like instead of a soundex.  For short names, the soundex returned almost the entire table
    making the process take too long.
  * Also changed the sql to only return individuals, also for the sake of performance.

== 1.1.0 2009-05-12

* 1 minor enhancement:
  * Modified the match alogorithm to reduct the score if there is not an address or city match if the data is in the database.
